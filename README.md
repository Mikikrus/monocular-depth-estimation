## ðŸš€ Introduction
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for monocular depth 
estimation with [The Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/). 
The main architecture is [UNet3+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08790),with the backbone sourced from 
the [timm library](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models), known for 
its effectiveness in semantic segmentation tasks. We leverage 
[PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/index.html) to streamline model 
training and reduce boilerplate code, and employ custom logger callbacks 
for real-time performance tracking.
